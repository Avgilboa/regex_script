0. is there is option to use more than one flag together?
 look at Q4.

1. when i get a regex in The teminal it is it can be string type or i get none type?
python3 regex.py -f "--regex--" || python3 regex.py -f --regex--

2.Will The script run after run the file or i start the file with the parameters?


2.1. What to do with sytax error ( ) , " " and space in the terminal that can accepted?

3. -f represent on file or some files? 
3A. files!

4. how to represent the string with and without -m?
4A. The '-m' represent macine type that less readable : 
-m format: file_name:no_line:start_pos:matched_text_only
other formats : filename::no_line The line we find the text in.
There is an option to print the machine mode format or the regular format 

5.When i get the flags -u and the other.
in the output- the flags : '-u' and '-c' work together but '-m' work only with himself (machine type).

6. is the string will catch on the line like the files or in other place?
it will catch from the stdin from the next line.
we will do pipe with echo: "my_string" | python regex.py -r --regex_expr--
